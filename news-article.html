         <p class="sidebar">
            The show stars three pettrol heads that is Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May.
            They showcase various cars on the show, new cars, old school cars, remodeled cars, car history and 
            also go on adventures with the cars with a certain challenge set or with a goal to prove something
            about the cars they are using. The show is just awesome with drama and some good conversations about 
            the car industry and what is new in other countries and projects being done by some of the big car 
            companies
